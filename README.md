## Description

Are you dieting? Holed up hiding from the po-po? Or just hundreds of miles from the nearest burger joint? This app lets you eat da burger, even if you don't have access to da burger. Enter new burgers to eat, eat them, then (if you're feeling rude and selfish) delete all traces of their noble sacrifice.

## Usage Guide

Using this app is as simple as navigating in a browser to https://frozen-sands-92246.herokuapp.com/.

Once there, the user can simply click the "Get Started" button or navigate directly to the webpage URL [/notes](https://frozen-sands-92246.herokuapp.com/notes/). Everything else should be self-explanitory.

### Style Recommendations

It is recommended to users to make their titles as descriptive as possible. This way, they can easily recognize what the notes are about later. Titles like "Note1" may be easier to think up at the moment, but can lead to frustration down the line if a user has several accumulated notes over several days.

### Help and Hints

For users that are unaware of common computer conventions (Hey, no judgement here), the save button looks like an icon of a 3Â½ inch floppy disk, the delete button looks like an icon of a trash-can, and the edit button looks like an icon of a pencil-tip.

## Questions and Reporting

This app was an assignement to help me learn server-side programming and node.js. There are other apps that do this better than mine, so support will be limited to non-existent. If, for some reason, you feel the need to use my app and run into problems, feel free to contact me through [my github](https://kirkpatrickpaul.github.io/contact.html).
